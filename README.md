# Diabetes-Risk-Calculator
This is an End-to-End Data Science project which can predict whether a person has diabetes, or not, based on information about the patient such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, etc.

This Web App is live at : [Diabetes Risk Calculator.](https://diabetes-risk-calculator.herokuapp.com/)

### Conclusions About the model:
* Glucose level, BMI, pregnancies and diabetes pedigree function have significant influence on the model, specially glucose level and BMI. It is good to see my machine learning model match what we have been hearing from doctors our entire lives!

* Blood pressure has a negative influence on the prediction, i.e. higher blood pressure is correlated with a person not being diabetic. (also, note that blood pressure is more important as a feature than age, because the magnitude is higher for blood pressure).

### Accuracy achieved: 98.25% (Random Forest)
